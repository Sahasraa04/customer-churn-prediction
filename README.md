📊 Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service). This project includes a full end-to-end pipeline — data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction — implemented in Python.

🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges companies face, especially in subscription-based industries. Predicting churn helps businesses take proactive steps to retain customers.

This project uses machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in customer behavior and predict whether a customer will churn.
